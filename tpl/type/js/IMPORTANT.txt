IMPORTANT:

Note that 'type_row_fields.js' file is NOT the final used file for web (because include imports).
Use instead the compiled file 'type_row_fields-min.js' to load in the page
The target file is bundled with IIFE
(e.g., "rollup type_row_fields.js --file type_row_fields-min.js --format iife --name type_row_fields_min")
